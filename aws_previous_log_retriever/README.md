This script is for retrieving the "Previous" logs from my AWS environment. Unlike copying the current catalina logs, this will pull the proevious logs. Perhaps your pods rebooted and you want to see why.

You'll most likely need to update to your cluster in the script! Line #6.

Also the output directoy, mine is set to /home/aws_files/.
